# convlstm_p3d    

* It's my bachelor thesis that I wrote about 3 years ago.      
* There could be a lot of typo and error. Any comments are appreciated.      
* I made this repogitory to organize my previous personal / toy projects.    
* I lost my original code. I would update the code after digging in my old deep learning machine disk.       
* There are some log of training, testing, validating, and the paper with chart.    
* After 6 page, Contents are wrotten in English.   

## Idea    

* Improving temporal feature comprehension.    
* There was a trade off in computational cost per a iteration, but the overall training time was reduced.
* At the same time, Improved the top1 precision of k-fold validation.
